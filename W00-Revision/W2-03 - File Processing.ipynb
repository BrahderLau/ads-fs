    "## CSV Files\n",
    "\n",
    "A Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text. Most often than not, the CSV file can be comfortably parsed and opened in spreadsheet programs such as MS Excel, OpenOffice Calc and etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Rules \n",
    "\n",
    "- CSV is a delimited data format that has fields/columns separated by the comma (,) character and records/rows terminated by newlines.\n",
    "- A CSV file does not require a specific character encoding, byte order, or line terminator format (some software does not support all line-end variations).\n",
    "- A record ends at a line terminator. However, line-terminators can be embedded as data within fields, so software must recognize quoted line-separators (see below) in order to correctly assemble an entire record from perhaps multiple lines.\n",
    "- All records should have the same number of fields, in the same order.\n",
    "- Adjacent fields must be separated by a single comma. However, \"CSV\" formats vary greatly in this choice of separator character. In particular, in locales where the comma is used as a decimal separator, semicolon (;), TAB, or other characters are used instead.\n",
