This is how you pay off the personal loan and car debt within a year.

To be honest, I thought I was okay and that I am educated financially.

Turns out when I became a client and studied their education portal, there were just a lot of things that I didn’t know before. Like seriously?! What a shame.

Especially on bad debts. Only now do I know that there’s a good debt and a bad debt.

So, for those of you who have a car, credit card, or personal loan debt (think of it as bad debt because these things can destroy us), you can try practicing this method.

It’s interesting how they used the concept of debt stretch and debt swap to "eliminate" personal loan + car debt.

It seems that it is not impossible to pay off the car debt and personal loan within a year. There’s another client who successfully paid off 2 personal loans and 2 car loans within a year.

Some have managed to settle a personal loan of more than RM200,000 by buying just one property. This will be my priority right now. I'm so tired of paying thousands for car debt and personal loans every month.
