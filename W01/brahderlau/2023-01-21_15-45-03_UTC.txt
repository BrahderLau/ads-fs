Why do they have so many haters even though they helped a lot of people?
•
One of the strangest things was when I started talking about joining FAR Capital, I got a lot of DMs saying that it was a scam, telling me to be careful and don’t join.
•
I thought it was strange, so I asked another client. This is the conclusion I got from the haters who don't like FAR Capital:
 [𝟏] Real Estate Agent Gangs: People don't like Faizul and FAR Cap because they have properties that are more expensive than the price FAR Cap can get. Because of FAR Cap, the existing property that they have will be difficult to sell because it’s more expensive than what we buy from FAR Capital.
 [𝟐] Auction Agent Gangs: People wonder why there are properties that FAR Capital buys that are cheaper than auction houses from banks. So, it's hard for agents to sell the same house when people can get it for a more worthy deal and save a lot of capital.
 [𝟑] Same House Owner: Apparently those who bought the same house with RM50,000 to RM200,000 are more expensive. It’s only logical that they hate FAR Capital.
 [𝟒] Those who are in the same business are pretty much the same. Because Faizul and FAR Capital is the biggest by far the biggest name in the industry, that’s why people like to attack and slander all kinds of things.

Everyone says they are not clients. When I ask for the names of people who have been scammed or mistreated, they can’t even drop one.
•
I'm confused, because if it's true that the person was scammed, why can’t they expose the full case study, and show who was the victim?
