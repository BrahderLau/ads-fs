All this while, I thought that if you buy a property, you will have to spend a lot of money. I have just learned that if we buy a house 𝟑𝟎%-𝟓𝟎% below market value, we can even get paid to buy that house. This is ridiculous!!!

Yes, not only do we buy property without capital, we also can get RM50,000 to RM100,000 in cash when buying a property. What kind of sorcery is this?

I also just finally understood why clients who work for average wages (B40 & M40) can afford to buy a house for a few cents. Apparently, people don't have to pay and are ready to pay again when they buy a house.

I just found out that there is a FAR Capital client who can get cash more than RM200,000 when buying a property. Some are ready to quit their jobs because they have the capital to open a business and get a lot of money like this. Some are ready to send their family to Hajj/Umrah using this money.

Later when I have time, I will share how people can settle personal loans and car loans within a year.
