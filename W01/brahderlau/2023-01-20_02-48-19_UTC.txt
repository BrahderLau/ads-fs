Is it logical to buy a house with a 30% - 50% discount?
•
The other day I shared how we can get paid by purchasing a property. It may sound too good to be true for some.
•
However, we will get a lot of cash when we buy a house with a 30% - 50% discount
•
At first I was curious too, who gives such huge discounts like this? Now I understand that if we purchase a lot of units, we will get a greater discount from the vendor.
•
FAR Capital can get discounts up to more than 50% because they bought hundreds of units, as they call bulk purchasing.
•
No wonder they can buy properties without capital and get such discounts. It’s smart that they ‘used’ us as a client to put pressure on developers to get more discounts. Such a capitalist.
•
I don’t mind being used, though. What’s important is that ultimately, I get to buy properties cheaper than others.
