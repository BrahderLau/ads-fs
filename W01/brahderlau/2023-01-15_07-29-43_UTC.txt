𝐔𝐏𝐃𝐀𝐓𝐄 𝟑: 𝐅𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐬

Someone shared their feedback with me. Thanks for sharing.

Additionally, I also did some research too. Some people say this seems like a scam, too good to be true, and had lots of negative things to say.

While some said that FR provides good service and deals, and has achieved a lot of success based on their testimonials. 

When I google it myself, so far it looks okay. I realised expert like iherng who has 12 years experiences in real estate industry is also one of the FAR Capital client. Also, today I just found out that they have already expanded over 20,000 clients. Last year they were appointed by the minister of KPKT as a panel of experts. They have been on TV1, TV2, and in many and in many newspapers, etc.

So far it still looks okay, so let's listen, ask questions, and assess it ourselves during the live session tonight (15 Jan, 8.30pm)
