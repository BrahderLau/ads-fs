𝐔𝐏𝐃𝐀𝐓𝐄 𝟐: 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐣𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐎𝐧-𝐃𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐖𝐞𝐛𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐫

I've just attended few of their short webinars. As for now, I’ve got the answer to my problems. It’s just that I’m still not so sure.

It turns out that they have another live session every Sunday. And based on what Faizul Ridzuan a.k.a FR said, he will share the complete strategy on how can I improve my financial status within 2023 this year.

With that, I’ve decided to join the Sunday live session which is tomorrow night (15 Jan, 9pm) . It's still 𝐅𝐑𝐄𝐄 anyway, no need to pay anything. After attending the session, I will share what I learned with you guys.

Btw, once I have the link for the Sunday live session, I will share it as soon as I could. Stay tuned!

FYI again the 𝐅𝐑𝐄𝐄 short webinar links that you can watch before joining the Sunday Live session are at the comments below.
